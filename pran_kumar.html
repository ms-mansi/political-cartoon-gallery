         <h2>Pran Kumar Sharma</h2></center>
        <p>Pran Kumar Sharma (15 August 1938 – 5 August 2014), better known as Pran, was an Indian cartoonist best known as the creator of Chacha Chaudhary (1971). He also created other characters like Shrimatiji, Pinki, Billoo, Raman, and Channi Chachi</p>
           
        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>Pran began his career in 1960 as a cartoonist for the Delhi-based newspaper Milap with comic strip Daabu. Apart from Daabu, Indian comics scenario was largely based on reprints of The Phantom and Superman.[3] In 1969, Pran sketched Chacha Chaudhary for the Hindi magazine Lotpot, which made him famous.[4] Pran has also created other cartoon characters like Shrimatiji, Pinki, Billoo, Raman, Channi Chachi and others, which are regularly published in Indian magazines. Pran reached lakhs of Kannadigas through his Putti, Raman that were published in Kannada daily Prajavani and Shrimathi which publishes in Kannada magazine Sudha. He was included in People of the Year 1995 by Limca Book of Records for popularizing comics in India.[5] In 1983, the then Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi released Pran's comics "Raman - Ham Ek Hain" which promoted national integration. Pran received a Lifetime Achievement Award 2001, from Indian Institute of Cartoonists.[6] Pran has also given lessons in cartooning at the Pran's Media Institute, run by his son Nikhil.</p>

        <p>Pran started his career as a cartoonist in the 1960s. I was dumbfounded when I learned that. Being a cartoonist must have been a lunatic’s dream back then. On top of that, Pran wanted to make comics for children. Even those who were crazy enough to pursue a career in the arts stuck to producing political content for newspapers and serious publications. The nascent comic book market in India back then was up until then, an American syndicate. It largely consisted of mere reprints of Phantom, Superman etc. An Indian comic strip with Indian characters was rare. In his own words, he felt like he was an ‘ant’ pitted against an ‘elephant’ but he was not afraid.
        </p>

        <p>It was in 1969 that Pran sketched Chacha Chaudhary, his most iconic character that redefined the lives of millions of children in India. Chacha Chaudhary was first published in a Hindi magazine called Lotpot. What strikes me about Chacha Chaudhary today, perhaps more so than when I was a kid, is that it is basically the antithesis of a typical American comic book plot. A short, frail, balding octogenarian superhero instead of a muscular, young man with rippling muscles and chilled jaws. A protagonist like that is hard to believe even today, let alone in the 1960s when masculinity and heroism were more rigidly defined.

        </p>
        <p>The 1980s gave Pran his big break when Diamond Comics approached him for a full comic book. The first two books that he did with Diamond Comics sold out within two weeks of their release and he became a household name. Over time, Pran brought several iconic Indian comic book characters to the market.
        </p>
   
        <P>As a child growing up in a small town in India in the 1990s, I was a big reader of all his works. While it is hard for me to reminisce about Nagraj, Dhruv or Doga much today, I still chuckle when I hear about Pinky or Billu. Pran’s work filled in the background of an Indian middle-class life so perfectly that it is hard to not feel nostalgic about it. Billu and Raman were really special in my opinion, as they let boys be boys. The likes of Nagraj and Dhruv were always in a hurry to make boys into men.
        
        <br>

        Pran’s story is extremely inspiring, especially in India where arts education is often believed to be not for boys and arts as a profession was mostly composed of people who consider drawing for children not manly. We are all aware of the need to encourage girls to persist in science & math but by the same token, should we not encourage boys to persist in Arts?</P>
