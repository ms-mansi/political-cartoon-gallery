         <h2>E.P. Unny</h2></center>
        <p>Famed for his fantastic illustrations in The Times of India and The Illustrated Weekly of India, Mario Miranda definitely glorified his spot as one of the top notch cartoonists of India. Born on 2 May, 1926 in the Portuguese province of India (now Daman), his real life cartoons always portrayed a strong imagery of the daily life. Mostly set in the backdrops of a street corner, food joints or some recreational place, his cartoons carried back and forth a vivid variety of emotions and daily life. His cartoons can be found replete over the walls of one of South Mumbai’s most famous locations, Cafe Mondegar at Colaba. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1988 and the Padma Bhushan in 2002. India Cartoonists’ Association, Bangalore, honoured him with a lifetime achievement award too. The cartoonist genius passed away in 2011. This year, Google paid homage to his talent with a Google doodle on his death anniversary.

            He hails from the Ekanath Family of Elappully, Palakkad. He studied physics at the University in the Indian state of Kerala.

            His first cartoon was published in Shankar's Weekly in 1973. He became a professional cartoonist in 1977 with The Hindu. E. P. Unny has worked with the Sunday Mail, The Economic Times and is now the Chief Political Cartoonist with The Indian Express Group.[1]
            
            He has drawn and written graphic novels in Malayalam and a travel book on Kerala - 'Spices and Souls - A doodler's journey through Kerala'. He is said to have been doing graphic shorts in Malayalam literary journals as early as the 1990s. He has also written Santa and the Scribes: The Making of Fort Kochi, which was published in 2014.
