         <h2>R.K. Laxman</h2></center>
        <p>R.K. Laxman, in full Rasipuram Krishnaswami Laxman, (born October 24, 1921, Mysore [now Mysuru], India—died January 26, 2015, Pune), Indian cartoonist who created the daily comic strip You Said It, which chronicled Indian life and politics through the eyes of the “common man,” a bulbous-nosed bespectacled observer dressed in a dhoti and a distinctive checked coat who served as a silent point-of-view character for readers.</p>

        <p> Laxman was the youngest of seven siblings, and he developed an affinity for drawing at an early age. While at Maharaja’s College in Mysore, he illustrated stories by his novelist brother, R.K. Narayan, in The Hindu newspaper. He subsequently turned to creating political cartoons for local newspapers. He worked at The Free Press Journal in Mumbai (Bombay) with Bal Thackeray, who was a cartoonist before founding the Shiv Sena political party. In 1951 Laxman moved to The Times of India, where he created You Said It, which adorned the newspaper’s front page into the 21st century. Laxman’s “common man” was witty and sarcastic but never venomous, and his outlook was said to represent that of countless average Indians. The comic strip also served as the basis for a comedy series on Indian TV, R.K. Laxman Ki Duniya (2011–13).

        <p>Laxman published numerous short stories, essays, and travel articles, some of which were collected in The Distorted Mirror (2003). He also wrote the novels The Hotel Riviera (1988) and The Messenger (1993) and an autobiography, The Tunnel of Time (1998). In addition, numerous collections of Laxman’s cartoons were published. In 2005 he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian honour.

        <p>Even as a student he had started contributing illustrations to newspapers and magazines. After graduation he continued his freelance work and contributed cartoons to ‘Swarajya’.
            He also drew illustrations for an animated film based on the mythological character Narada, working as a part of an animated film unit at Gemini Studios in Madras.
            He then moved to Bombay to explore newer avenues. There he tried his luck at several newspapers and finally started working for R.K. Karanjia’s weekly publication, ‘Blitz’. This proved to be his first break and he soon became popular as a cartoonist.
            In 1946 he joined the ‘Free Press Journal’ as a political cartoonist. It was here that he met fellow cartoonist Bal Thackeray who would eventually become a famous politician in future.
            He worked very hard at his job, and often did more than what the salary justified. He toiled for hours each day and produced a political cartoon every other day. However, some differences with his bosses made him leave the publication.
            By now he has become a renowned cartoonist and was appointed by ‘The Times of India’ in 1947 on a salary of Rs. 500—a princely sum in those days. Initially he provided illustrations for the ‘Illustrated Weekly of India’ and comic strips for a children’s magazine.
            Though he possessed a keen sense of politics, his editors did not appreciate his political cartoons much. But they changed their minds when one of his cartoons appeared in the ‘Evening News of India’ and was well received by the readers.
            Soon, his cartoons started appearing on the front page of ‘The Times of India’, and his reputation as a cartoonist grew day by day. Eventually, he became the paper’s chief political cartoonist.
            It was while working at ‘The Times of India’ that he came up with the idea for the cartoon strip ‘You Said It’, featuring the “Common Man”. The strip was witty and funny while at the same time serious and sarcastic. The Common Man was a mute spectator to the events unfolding before him—he represented the silent majority of India.
            He was also a writer in addition to being a cartoonist. Some of his novels are ‘The Hotel Riviera’ (1988) and ‘The Messenger ‘(1993). A collection of his short stories, essays and articles was published as ‘The Distorted Mirror’ in 2003.

        <h3>Major Works</h3>
        <p>He is best remembered as the creator of the “Common Man”, a balding, bespectacled middle-aged man dressed in a simple dhoti who represented the average Indian. The character was so popular that he was even featured in a commemorative postage stamp released by the Indian Postal Service on the 150th anniversary of the ‘Times of India’ in 1988.</p>
