         <h2>Abu Abraham</h2></center>
        <p>Attupurathu Mathew Abraham (11 June 1924 – 1 December 2002), pen name Abu, was an Indian cartoonist, journalist, and author. In a career spanning 40 years, Abu Abraham worked for various national and international newspapers including The Bombay Chronicle, Shankar's Weekly, Blitz, Tribune, The Observer (1956–1966), The Guardian (1966–1969), and The Indian Express (1969–1981).
            <br>
        He was a lifelong atheist and rationalist</p>
        <p> Born in the humble village of Mavelikara in Kerala, Abu was the only child of A.M. Mathew and Kantamma. His interest in drawing cartoons began at the early age of three, and he took it along with him regardless of the different paths he explored in his lifetime. So while Abu's academics would reflect on his knowledge of French, Mathematics, and the English language, his career choices conveyed his true calling.
        </p>

        <p>Soon after graduating college in 1945, he shifted to Bombay and began working as a journalist for The Bombay Chronicle. Around the same time, he also contributed as a freelancer to The Bombay Sentinel, Blitz, and Bharat. His works garnered attention both within national and international space. As a result, he was encouraged to move to London to exhibit his talents on a larger platform. Fred Joss from the London Star was among those who encouraged the artist to make the leap, and soon enough, Abu's cartoons made their way to the international publications of Punch Magazine, Daily Sketch, Everybody's London Opinion, Eastern World, and so on.

        </p>
        <p>While at that time, it was no cakewalk for an Indian to adjust to British culture, Abu blended well with the crowd and grew popular for his incisive political cartoons. Abu, under the pen name 'Abraham,' was also approached by David Astor, editor of one of the world's oldest Sunday newspapers, The Observer. Astor had penned a personal letter asking for Abu and offering him a permanent post as the newspaper's first-ever political cartoonist.
        </p>
        <h2>Loud Voices During Emergency</h2>
        <P>After returning to India, he started working as a political cartoonist for Indian Express. He was quite an active figure in the political arena and was nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1975, when Indira Gandhi declared the Emergency and suspended freedom of the press, Abu ensured that the press did not remain silenced. He fell out with her and published a book named Games of the Emergency. The book was a compilation of political articles and cartoons that exposed the real side of the Emergency.
        
        <br>

        According to Wikipedia, the artist was often described as "the conscience of the Left and the pea under the princess's mattress". He was highly vocal with his criticisms against corruption and made the ruling government and other parties uncomfortable with his drawings. Years of challenging the government and state, he released multiple cartoons, books, and articles that provided a differential insight into the mass-narrated history of the country. On December 1, 2002, Abu took his last breath in his hometown and was cremated with full state honours for the legacy he left behind.</P>
